This is the root directory for MemCacheDManager.

Sadly, I don't have the time to keep up on changes to MemCacheD. While it's a great product, I wasn't able to use it for my project. 

Happily, I want you to continue on enhancing the software!

So, feel free to code away, and maybe commit a change for all the share. 

Thanks,
Nick.
