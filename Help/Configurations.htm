		Manage Configurations for Multiple Environments</h3>
		<p>
			MemCacheD manager supports using xml configuration files for the servers running
			MemCacheD in your environment. This allows you to have separate configuration files
			for your development, staging and production environments. This also allows you
			to share configuration files between workstations, or to place configuration files
			on a share for multiple administrators to use. At this time, MemCacheD Manager does
			not handle file concurrency on the configuration file, so you will need to reload
			it if another user changes it.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you first start MemCacheD Manager, it will create a blank configuration file
			for you called Default.xml. This file will reside in the same directory as MemCacheD
			Manager. MemCacheD Manager will always load the last configuration file that you
			were working with when you start it. If you wish to create a new configuration file,
			simply select <em>File-&gt;New Configuration</em> from the main menu. You will then
			be presented with an empty MemCacheD Manager main window, and you then can work
			with MemCacheD Manager. Saves to the configuration file are done as soon as you
			click Apply on all screens.
