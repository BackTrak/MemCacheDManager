		Creating a New MemCacheD Instance<br />
		<br />
		Before you can create a MemCacheD instance on a server, you should first define
		the server in the MemCacheD manager. Please <a href="CreateNewServer.htm">see this section</a>
		if you do not already
		have a server defined.
		<br />
		<br />
		MemCacheD manager can control many servers, with each server running one or more
		instances (a configuration of MemCacheD running as a Windows service).

		<br />
		You can add instances of MemCacheD to your server by right-clicking on the server's
		name and then selecting "<em>Add New Instance</em>".
		<br />
		<br />
		Specify the Instance Name, and configure any of the MemCacheD parameters to tune
		MemCacheD to your environment, and then click <em>Apply.</em> MemCacheD will then
		be copied to the server if it's already present, and then installed as a Windows
		service.
		<br />
		<br />
		MemCacheD is now running on your server.<br />
