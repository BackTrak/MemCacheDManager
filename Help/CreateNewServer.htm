			Create a new MemCacheD server<br />
		</h3>
		<p>
			When you want install or control a server running MemCacheD services, you first
			define the server in the MemCacheD manager. You then add "Instances" (MemCacheD
			windows services) to the server.
		</p>
		<p>

		<p>
			When you first start MemCacheD Manager, you are presented with an empty window.
			Click the <em>Add Server </em>button to add your first server to the list.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>

		<p>
			Enter your server's name into the Server Name box. If you need to use a specific
			account (IE other than the account you are logged in with) click the Use Impersonation
			box and enter your account details. If you need to use a windows domain account
			use the standard <em>domain\username</em> syntax. Click the <em>Apply</em> button
			to add the server. After you click <em>Apply</em>, MemCacheD Manager will scan the
			server to find any previously installed instances of MemCacheD which may already
			be running on that server. You can also use the refresh button to have MemCacheD
			Manager pick up instances that may have been manually added while the server was
			managed by MemCacheD Manager.</p>
		<h3>
			Default Installation Path</h3>
		<p>
			The last box on the Server dialog is the Default Installation Path. This path specifies
			where the MemCacheD binary files will be copied to on the remote server. So, if
			I am configuring a server named MemCacheDServer, and the Default InstallationPath
			is set to C:\Program Files\MemCacheD\memcached.exe, then each instance of MemCacheD
			on MemCacheDServer will run from the following path:</p>
		<p>
			\\MemCacheDServer\c$\Program Files\MemCacheD\memcached.exe</p>
		<p>
			MemCacheD manager will automatically create this directory and copy the memcached.exe
			and associated binary files to your server when you create your first instance on
			the server.
