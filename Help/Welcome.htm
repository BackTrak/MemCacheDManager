		<h3>
		Introduction</h3>
		This utility is designed to reduce your administration tasks when deploying and
		maintaining a running MemCacheD environment. It has the following features:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Able to remotely create, edit and control MemCacheD as a windows service.</li>
			<li>Use Windows account credentials for impersonation so that you can deploy to multiple
				Windows domains from a single administration console.</li>
			<li>Uses simple files so that configuration can be shared between administrators.</li>
			<li>Give a simple status view of all the MemCacheD services in your enterprise and some
				basic health metrics.</li>
			<li>Enables simple parameter setting and viewing of MemCacheD settings in your enterprise.</li>
			<li>Can discover manually installed MemCacheD services on a given server.</li>
			<li>Can generate .Net configuration sections for .Net MemCacheD APIs for easy integration.</li>
			<li>Allows you to detect when a server is not running your version of MemCacheD.</li>
			<li>Allows you to perform upgrades of MemCacheD to a particular version remotely.</li>
			<li>Use multiple configuration files for your various environments.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The utility has some caveats that you should be aware of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Does not work with non-Windows MemCacheD instances.</li>
			<li>Requires WMI to be installed and running on all machines that you would like to
				administer.</li>

				(Impersonation is supported).</li>
		</ul>
